# Wrath of Kings Army Builder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dsusco/wok-army-builder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dsusco/wok-army-builder)

An AngularJS SPA army builder for CoolMiniOrNot's Wrath of Kings: http://wok-army-builder.appspot.com

---

## The TL;DR Start

Assuming [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed and the [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) and [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) packages are installed globally:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dsusco/wok-army-builder.git
    $ cd wok-army-builder
    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ grunt watch

That should open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in a browser.

## Props

This began life as an [ngBoilerplate](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) project, thanks ngbp team.
